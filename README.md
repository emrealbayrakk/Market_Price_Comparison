# Market_Price_Comparison

#About :
  Hello guys, I would like to tell you about the project that I did without knowing how to use git, by adding it today.
  This project enables to pull and compare the products of the markets in Konya. In addition, we thought of adding brochures and campaigns.
  Pulling the data with Python and converting it to Json was undertaken by my friend.
  I undertook the backend and frontend development of this project.
  
  #How to run
  After cloning the repo, you can start it from any .html with the live server.
  
  #Note
  When I wrote this project, I didn't know how to use git.
  Also, unfortunately, I used Turkish characters in the variables. I'm not like this anymore :)
